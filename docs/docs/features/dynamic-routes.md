```bash title="File System"
app/
  blog/
    # highlight-next-line
    [id].js # Matches: ùù†.com/blog/123
```

Dynamic routes match any unmatched path at a given segment level. For example, `/blog/[id]` is a dynamic route. The variable part (`[id]`) is called a "slug". Routes with higher specificity will be matched before a dynamic route. For example, `/blog/bacon` will match `blog/bacon.js` before `blog/[id].js`.

The slug can be accessed from the `route.params.[name]` prop in the component:

```tsx title=app/blog/[id].js
export default function BlogPost({ route }) {
  return (
    <Text>
      // highlight-next-line
      {route.params.id}
    </Text>
  );
}
```

> By [popular demand](https://twitter.com/Baconbrix/status/1567538444246589441), the dynamic routes pattern is based on the [Next.js dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes) system.

There are a couple different ways to implement dynamic routes, here are some existing formats:

| Format              | Framework |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| `/blog/[id].js`     | Next.js   |
| `/blog/[id].svelte` | SvelteKit |
| `/blog/$id.js`      | Remix     |

## Deep Dynamic Routes

![](./assets/deep-dynamic-roots.png)

```bash title="File System"
app/
  blog/
    # highlight-next-line
    [...id].js # Matches: ùù†.com/blog/123/456
```

Similar to dynamic routes, but the slug matches any number of unmatched path components in a route. For example, `/blog/[...id]` is a deep dynamic route where `[...id]` is the slug. `blog/[...ids].js` will match `/blog/1/2/3`.

:::danger Pending research

This convention is subject to breaking changes.

Directory names can also be deep dynamic routes. For example, `/blog/[...id]/home.js` will match `/blog/1/2/3/home`.

<details>
  <summary>Interoperability</summary>

Deep dynamic routes are functionally analogous to the 'optional catch-all dynamic routes' (`[[...id]].js`) feature from Next.js but the syntax is the same as the 'required catch-all dynamic routes'. Unlike Next.js which has a separate syntax for matching everything except `/`, Expo uses the same syntax for both. If you want to match everything except index, you can add an `index.js` file that has custom handling or you could simply handle the slug differently. We also reserve the term **catch** for error handling.

The convention is also similar to splats in Remix.

## Priority

Routes with the highest specificity will be matched first. For example a **deep dynamic route** is less specific than a **dynamic route**, which is less specific than a named **route**. The following routes will match in the following order:

```bash title="File System"
app/
  blog/
    index.js # Matches: ùù†.com/blog/
    hello.js # Matches: ùù†.com/blog/hello
    [dynamic].js # Matches: ùù†.com/blog/123
    [...deep].js # Matches: ùù†.com/blog/123/456
```
